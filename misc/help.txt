::+ban
###  %b+ban%b <hostmask> [channel] [%%<XdXhXm>] [comment]
   Adds a ban to the list of bans stored on the bot, with optional comment and
   ban time. This ban is stored with your handle as the creator, and will be
   in effect for every channel if no channel is specified. Prefixing a comment
   with '@' will make it only visible within the bot, and not used as the ban
   reason. Ban time has to be expressed in days, hours, and/or minutes.

   also reference the ban by the number shown by the 'bans' command.
 
See also: bans, +ban, stick, unstick
:hub:-bot
###  %b-bot%b <bot>
   This is exactly the same as %b'%d-user'%b (it removes a user record). It is
   included for convenience.
 
See also: +user, -user%{+n}, newleaf
::-chan
### %b-chan%b <channel>
     This removes ALL information about a channel from the bot. 
 
     %f*** IMPORTANT ***%f
 
     This erases ALL information about the channel, including channel settings,
     bans, exempts, invites, and channel records for users -- %bEVERYTHING%b.
 
     %bDO NOT%b use it to have the bot temporarily leave a channel. This
     command is for abandoning a channel (e.g. the channel will have to be
     redefined and all user flags for that channel will have to be redone.
 
     If you want to do this try '%dcycle' or '%ddown'

   Removes the specified ignore from the list of ignores stored on the bot. You
   may also reference the ignore by the number shown by the 'ignores' command.
 
See also: +ignore, ignores
::-invite
###  %b-invite%b <hostmask or number>
   Removes the specified invite from the list of invites stored on the bot. You
   may also reference the invite by the number shown by the 'invites' command.
 
See also: invites, +invite, stick, unstick
::-noteign
###  %b-noteign%b%{+m} [user]%{-} <ignoremask>

::about:
###  %babout%b
   If you feel you are missing from the list feel free to contact bryan.
:leaf:act
###  %bact%b [channel] <text>
   Performs an action on the current console channel (or otherwise
   specified channel), as if the bot did it.  Just like the /me
   command in IRC.
 
See also: console
::addlog
###  %baddlog%b <text>
   Adds your comment to the bot's logfile. Bot masters can go back later and
   review the log, and will see your comment (with your handle attached). This
   is useful for explaining confusing activity.
:leaf:adduser
###  %badduser%b [!]<nickname> [handle]
   Creates a new user record for a user on the channel, using their
   current hostname.  It's similar to a user msg'ing the bot 'hello'
   except that no information is sent to that user.  If the bot
   already knows someone by that nickname, and the user on the channel
   doesn't have a bot record, then it does the equivalent of an
   'ident' for that user -- except that, again, no information is
   sent to the user telling them that anything was done.
 
   If the user is using a different nickname than the bot normally
   knows her by, you can specify her "handle" (the nickname that the
   bot remembers).
 
   If you want to add a user using a static hostmask, prefix their nick
   with a '!'. i.e. .adduser !Lamer

:leaf:authed:
###  %bauthed%b
   Displays users who are authed on the bot for chan/msg cmds.
::away
###  %baway%b [reason]
   Marks you as "away" on the party line. Your away message will show up in
   the %b'%dwho'%b list, and will be displayed to anyone who tries to send you
   a note. Your notes will be stored, and then displayed to you as soon as you
   are no longer away. Saying something on the party line will automatically
   remove your "away" status, or you can type %b'%dback'%b or %b'%daway'%b by
   itself.
 
See also: back
::back
###  %bback%b
   This marks you as no longer away on the party line.
 
See also: away
:hub:backup
###  %bbackup%b
   This makes the bot write a backup of its entire user list to the disk. 
   This is useful if you feel the need to backup the userfile and channel
   settings.
 
See also: reload, save
::bans
###  %bbans%b [[channel/all]/wildcard]
   Shows you a list of the global bans active on the current channel, and the
   list of channel-specific bans, as well as any bans that are on the channel
   but weren't placed by the bot.
 
   Here's a sample entry;
      [ 5] *!*habib@*frys.com (perm)
           paulie: revolving check policy
           Created 15:10
 
   The number (5) can be used to reference the ban if you wish to remove it
   (see %b'-ban'%b). Next is the actual hostmask being banned. The "(perm)"
   means that the ban is "permanent": that is, it doesn't automatically expire.
   If there is an elapsed time showing instead, the time displayed is how long
   the ban has been active. These types of bans expire after two hours. The
   second line of the ban entry is the comment ("revolving check policy"), and
   who set the ban (paulie). The last line shows when the ban was added, and
   possibly the last time the ban was activated on the channel (if it's
   different from the creation time).
 
   Sometimes there will be a "!" or "*" right before the number. A "!" means
   the ban is in the bot's ban list, but is not currently on the channel. A "*"
   marks a ban which is NOT in the bot's ban list but IS on the channel.
 
   If you use 'bans' without an argument, it will show you only the bans which
   are currently active on the channel. If you use 'bans all', it will show you
   every ban in the global ban list and on the channel. If you use 'bans
   <wildcard>', it will list all bans (active or not) that match against your
   wildcard. Consider it a 'bans all' list matched against your wildcard.
 
   The ban list may change according to which channel you're currently viewing
   in the console. Different bans may be active on different channels. If you
   specify a channel name, that channel will be used instead of your current
   console channel.

:hub:bc:
###  %bbc%b <bot> <cmd> [params]
   See: botcmd
:hub:binds
###  %bbinds%b [type/match] [all]
   Shows the Tcl bindings in effect, in a list similar to this:
      Command bindings:
        TYPE FLGS COMMAND              HITS BINDING (TCL)
        msg  -|-  rose                    0 msg_rose
        msg  -|-  go                      0 msg_go
        dcc  m|-  bind                    0 cmd_bind
        pub  -|-  gross                   0 pub_gross
   The fields should be self-explanatory, except for HITS, which records the
   number of times that binding has been called. If not, go read the file
   %b'doc/tcl-commands.doc'%b for help on the Tcl bind command. Note that the
   builtin commands are now shown. You may also specify a type of binding to
   show (i.e. %b'%dbinds msg'%b) or you can specify a wild card match (i.e.
   %b'%dbinds *seen*'%b) if you want to narrow the field a bit. The wild card
   matches will match against the TYPE, COMMAND and BINDING fields. You can
   view more binds by adding 'all' to the end of the command.
 
See also: tcl
:hub:boot
###  %bboot%b <handle[@bot]> [reason]
   Kicks a user off the party line and displays the reason, if you specify
   one. You can also specify a bot, and attempt to boot someone from another
   bot on the botnet, though it may be rejected if that bot does not allow
   remote boots. You can not boot a bot owner.
:hub:botcmd:
###  %bbotcmd%b <bot> <cmd> [params]
   The specified cmd and optional parameters are executed on the specified bot, 
   all results are displayed back on DCC. For example:
     [19:29] #bryan# botcmd wtest whom ...
     [19:29] (wtest) #bryan# whom
     [wtest]  Nick
     [wtest] ----------
     [wtest] ^bryan
     [wtest] ^bryan     [idle 1h22m]
     [wtest] ^bryan     [idle 1h22m]
     [wtest] Total users: 3
 
   The bot specified can also have wildcards in it. '*' for 1 or more chars, and
   '?' for exactly 1 char. Use this cmd carefuly, and even think about placing
   a cmdpass on it.
 
See also: bc, cmdpass
:hub:botconfig:
###  %bbotconfig%b <bot> [name [value|-]]
   Set's a bot specific entry.
   NOTE: 'config' and 'botconfig' have different entries. 
   If there is a botconfig entry for 'name' and a config entry for 'name', 
   the bot will use the 'botconfig' entry. Otherwise, the 'config' entry
   will be used for all options.
 
See also: botconfig
:hub:botinfo
###  %bbotinfo%b
   Requests information from every bot currently on the botnet. Each bot should
   eventually send you one line containing its version, network setting,
   channels, and uptime.
 
See also: %{+n}bottree, vbottree%{+m}, bots
::botjump:
###  %bbotjump%b <bot> [server [port [pass]]]
   Makes the bot jump to another server. If you don't specify a
   server, it will jump to the next server in it's internal list (see
   %b'help config'%b). If you specify a server, it will jump to that
   server (default port is 6667), and if that server is not in the
   internal list already, it will add it (until the bot relinks).
   Jumping servers ALWAYS makes the bot lose ops! be careful!
 
See also: jump, servers, botserver
::botmsg:
###  %bbotmsg%b <bot> <nickname|#chan> <text>
   sends a private message to someone from the bot, just as if the
   bot had typed /msg.
 
See also: msg%{+n}, netmsg
::botnick:
###  %bbotnick%b <bot>
   The bot will display it's current nick over DCC.
 
See also: netnick
:hub:bots
###  %bbots%b
   Shows the list of bots currently on the botnet.
   Example:
      Bots: cEvin, ruthie, Killa1
   There is no indication of which bots are directly connected to this current
   bot. %{+n}Use %b'%dwho'%b or %b'%dbottree'%b for that information.%{-}
 
See also: downbots%{+n}, bottree, vbottree%{-}, botinfo
::botserver:
###  %bbotserver%b <bot>
   The bot will display it's current server and lag over DCC.
 
See also: netserver, servers%{+n}, config
:hub:bottree
###  %bbottree%b
   Shows a tree-format diagram of the bots currently on the botnet. It's just a
   nice way to get a feel for how the bots are physically connected. If 2 bots
   are sharing, a + will be indicated, or a ? if nothing is known.
 
See also: bots, downbots, botinfo, vbottree
::botversion:
###  %bbotversion%b <bot>
   The bot will display it's pack version and uname.
 
See also: netversion, about%{+m|m}, status
:hub:chaddr
###  %bchaddr%b <bot> <address[:bot port[/user port]]>
   Changes the address for a bot. This is the address your bot will try to
   connect to when linking. If the bot has a separate port for bots and users,
   they should be separated  by a slash (/).
%{+a}
   It is not recommneded that this is used, you should change your source,
   and update all bots instead.
%{-}

::chaninfo:
###  %bchaninfo%b <channel>
     This lists all the settings for the bot on the given channel.
     It shows any of the following:
        %bchanmode%b   These modes are enforced on the channel. Both + and -
                   modes can be enforced.
        %bidle-kick%b  Kick idle users that are not +f or above on the channel
                   after how many minutes (set this to 0 to disable).
%{+m|m}
        %blimit-raise%b       If this is set, the +l bot will raise the limit 
                          to the users in the channel + this ammount. Set to 
                          0 to disable.
        %bstopnethack-mode%b  This setting will make the bot de-op anyone who
                          enters the channel with serverops. There are seven
                          different modes for this settings:
                            0 turn off
                            1 isoptest (allow serverop if registered op)
                            2 wasoptest (allow serverop if user had op before
                              split)
                            3 allow serverop if isop or wasop
                            4 allow serverop if isop and wasop
                            5 If the channel is -bitch, see stopnethack-mode 3
                              If the channel is +bitch, see stopnethack-mode 1
                            6 If the channel is -bitch, see stopnethack-mode 2
                              If the channel is +bitch, see stopnethack-mode 4
        %brevenge-mode%b      This settings defines how the bot should punish
                          bad users when revenging. There are four possible
                          settings:
                            0 Deop the user.
                            1 Deop the user and give them the +d flag for the
                              channel.
                            2 Deop the user, give them the +d flag for the
                              channel, and kick them.
                            3 Deop the user, give them the +d flag for the
                              channel, kick, and ban them.
        %bclosed-ban%b        Set this to 1 to ban users who join +closed 
                          channels. This is probably not needed though, as
                          +closed maintains +i.
        %bban-time%b          Set here how long temporary bans will last (in
                          minutes). If you set this setting to 0, the bot will
                          never remove them.
        %bexempt-time%b       Set here how long temporary exempts will last (in
                          minutes). If you set this setting to 0, the bot will
                          never remove them. The bot will check the exempts
                          every X minutes, but will not remove the exempt if a
                          ban is set on the channel that matches that exempt.
                          Once the ban is removed, then the exempt will be
                          removed the next time the bot checks. Please note
                          that this is an IRCnet feature.
        %binvite-time%b       Set here how long temporary invites will last (in
                          minutes). If you set this setting to 0, the bot will
                          never remove them. The bot will check the invites
                          every X minutes, but will not remove the invite if a
                          channel is set to +i. Once the channel is -i then the
                          invite will be removed the next time the bot checks.
                          Please note that this is an IRCnet feature.
     The following can be set + or - (e.g. .chanset #channel -enforcebans)
        %bbitch%b          Only let users with the +o flag have op on the
                       channel?
        %bclosed%b         Kick all people who join channel unless they have
                       op access for the channel.
        %bcycle%b          Bot will attempt to cycle the channel when opless
                       or during splits to gain ops.
        %benforcebans%b    When a ban is set, kick people who are on the channel
                       and match the ban?
        %bfastop%b         Setting this will disable cookie-ops. You may
                       know cookie-ops as an annoying way of bots opping 
                       themselves with +o-b bot *!*@fjdifgjdsgiufufdhgfudghfdgfdg,
                       but, with -fastop (cookie-ops enabled), opping is much
                       more secure and the chances of someone hijacking the bot
                       for ops in your channel are much much less. This is
                       highly recommened to always be set. 
                       See '%dconfig bad-cookie' for punishment options.
                       
        %binactive%b       This prevents the bot from joining the channel (or
                       makes it leave the channel if it is already there). It
                       can be useful to make the bot leave a channel without
                       losing its settings, channel-specific user flags,
                       channel bans, and without affecting sharing.
        %bmanop%b          With this set, users will be able to op anyone
                       in the channel manually (as opposed to through the bot.)
                       With this unset, users are forced to op through the bot.
                       See '%dconfig manop' for punishment options.
        %bnodesynch%b      Allow non-ops to perform channel modes? This can stop
                       the bot from fighting with services such as ChanServ, or
                       from kicking IRCops when setting channel modes without
                       having ops.
        %bnomop%b          Users will not be allowed to set more than 3 +o 
                       modes at any given time.
                       See '%dconfig mop' for punishment options.
        %bprivate%b        This by far is probably the single most unique and
                       important feature of this pack. With this set, users with
                       global +o will not implicitly have access to the channel.
                       They will need to have channel |o flag to have access.
                       Users with global +n override this as they should have
                       control over the entire botnet and where it goes.
                       Users who lose access to a channel because of this setting
                       will see no reference to it over the botnet in any place.
        %bprotectops%b     Re-op a user with the +o flag if they get deopped?
                       DON'T USE THIS.
        %brevenge%b        Remember people who deop/kick/ban the bot, valid ops,
                       or friends and punish them? 
        %brevengebot%b     This is similar to to the 'revenge' option, but it
                       only triggers if a bot gets deopped, kicked or banned.
        %btake%b           Once a bot is opped, it will mass op all other bots
                       in the channel. After that, they will all attempt to 
                       mass deop in hopes 'taking' the channel. :)
        %bvoice%b          This feature is somewhat experimental. With it set
                       the +y bot will voice ALL people who join the channel
                       unless they are +q globally or +q for the channel.
                       If a botnet master devoices them, they will remain 
                       devoiced no matter who voices them.
        %bdynamicbans%b    Only activate bans on the channel when necessary?
                       This keeps the channel's ban list from getting
                       excessively long. The bot still remembers every ban,
                       but it only activates a ban on the channel when it sees
                       someone join who matches that ban.
        %buserbans%b       Allow bans to be made by users directly? If turned
                       off, the bot will require all bans to be made through
                       the bot's console.
        %bdynamicexempts%b Only activate exempts on the channel when
                       necessary? This keeps the channel's exempt list from
                       getting excessively long. The bot still remembers every
                       exempt, but it only activates a exempt on the channel
                       when it sees a ban set that matches the exempt. The
                       exempt remains active on the channel for as long as the
                       ban is still active.
        %buserexempts%b    Allow exempts to be made by users directly? If
                       turned off, the bot will require all exempts to be made
                       through the bot's console.
        %bdynamicinvites%b Only activate invites on the channel when necessary?
                       This keeps the channel's invite list from getting
                       excessively long. The bot still remembers every invite,
                       but the invites are only activated when the channel is
                       set to invite only and a user joins after requesting an
                       invite. Once set, the invite remains until the channel
                       goes to -i.
        %buserinvites%b    Allow invites to be made by users directly? If turned
                       off, the bot will require all invites to be made through
                       the bot's console.
     The following are flood settings, they are set via "%dchanset <channel>
     flood-type number:seconds", where number and second are integers
     indicating the number of times in how many seconds the flood will be
     triggered. Setting one of these to 0:0, 0:1, or 1:0 will deactivate the
     respective flood setting.
        %bflood-chan%b  Set here how many channel messages in how many seconds
                    from one host constitutes a flood. Setting this to 0 or 0:0
                    disables text flood protection for the channel.
        %bflood-ctcp%b  Set here how many channel ctcps in how many seconds from
                    one host constitutes a flood. Setting this to 0 or 0:0
                    disables ctcp flood protection for the channel.
        %bflood-join%b  Set here how many joins in how many seconds from one
                    host constitutes a flood. Setting this to 0 or 0:0 disables
                    join flood protection for the channel.
        %bflood-kick%b   Set here how many kicks in how many seconds from one
                    host constitutes a flood. Setting this to 0 or 0:0 disables
                    kick flood protection for the channel.
        %bflood-deop%b   Set here how many deops in how many seconds from one
                    host constitutes a flood. Setting this to 0 or 0:0 disables
                    deop flood protection for the channel.
        %bflood-nick%b   Set here how many nick changes in how many seconds from
                    one host constitutes a flood. Setting this to 0 or 0:0
                    disables nick flood protection for the channel.

:leaf:channel
###  %bchannel%b [channel-name]
   Shows you an extensive display of the users on a channel, and
   the current channel attributes.  By default, it shows you the
   channel you are currently viewing on the console, but you can
   specify another channel if you wish.
 
   The first line will look like:
      Channel #hiya, 8 members, 45 users, mode +tn:
   This means that the bot is sitting on channel #hiya, where 8
   other irc'ers are.  There are 45 people that the bot knows by
   hostmask, and the channel mode is +tn.  If the bot isn't on
   the channel it is supposed to be on, it will say "Desiring
   channel #hiya" instead.  Next is a list of the users on the
   channel, with each entry looking like this:
       NICKNAME  HANDLE    JOIN   HOPS IDLE  USER@HOST
      @kantSF    kantSF    14:53 o 2 6m  josh@random.edu
   The "@kantSF" means that the user's nickname is kantSF and that
   he is a chanop.  The second "kantSF" is the nickname that the
   bot knows him by.  Sometimes this will differ from the nickname
   a person is using.  The time displayed is the time the user
   joined the channel.  The next field is the attributes:
      n - bot owner                      o - can get ops (+o)
      m - bot master or owner            f - channel friend
      b - another bot                    d - cannot get ops (+d)
   The last field is the user@host he is using irc from.

::channels:
###  %bchannels%b %{+m}[user]%{-}
   Displays channels that you have access to, and any important 
   flags that are set on them.
%{+m}
   Masters: You can specify other users to see what channels their 
            flags grant them access to.%{-}
See also: whois%{+m}, chattr, chaninfo
::chanset
###  %bchanset%b <channel> <settings>
   Allows you to change the channel settings (see %b'chaninfo'%b for the
   settings) for one specific channel or all channels. Use '*' to to apply the
   change to all channels.
   Changes are used until the next restart, and are saved
   whenever the userfile is saved.
 
See also: %{+n}+chan, -chan%{-}, chaninfo
::chat
###  %bchat%b <on/off>
###  %bchat%b <[*]channel number/name>
   Changes your current channel on the partyline. When you first connect to
   the partyline, it places you on channel 0 (the main party line).
   Some channels may have assigned names if the assoc module is loaded. For
   these, you can specify the channel by name instead of channel number if
   you wish.
   %b'%dchat off'%b removes you from all channels, including the main party line.
   You can still use bot commands and see the console, but you can't talk to
   anyone except via %b'%dnote'%b. %b'%dchat on'%b returns you to the main party
   line (channel 0) if you were elsewhere.
   If you prefix the channel with a '*', you will join a local channel.
 
See also: console
::chattr
###  %bchattr%b <handle> [flags] [channel]
   This lets you view and change the flags for a user.
   For example, to give Lamer the p and f flags:
      .chattr Lamer +pf
   To remove Denali from the global op list:
      .chattr Denali -o
   You may also do any combination of the above:
      .chattr Fred1 -m+xj-o
   You can also change the flags for Usagi on a specific channel by supplying
   the channel after the attributes:
      .chattr Usagi -m+dk-o #blah
   Changing global and channel specific flags within the same command line is
   also possible (global +f, +o #lamer):
      .chattr Bill f|o #lamer
   Whether or not you change any flags, it will show you the user's attributes
   afterwards. To get a list of all possible flags, see %b'%dhelp whois'%b.
   %bNOTES:%b Only the owner may add or remove the 'a' (admin) or 'n' (owner) flags.
          It is pointless to -a a permanent owner.
          You must remove the permanent owner in the binary.
 
See also: whois
:hub:chhandle
###  %bchhandle%b <oldhandle> <newhandle>
   Changes the handle of a user. For example, to change the handle of user
   'gavroche' to 'jamie', you would use 'chhandle gavroche jamie'.
 
See also: chpass%{+n}, chsecpass
::chinfo
###  %bchinfo%b <user> [channel] [info-line/none]
   Sets the information line for a user. This line is shown via the /msg
   commands %b'who'%b and %b'whois'%b. If you have set greet on, it is also
   shown when the user joins the channel. If the info line begins with an '@',
   then it is "locked", and that user may no longer change it. If the channel
   name is omitted, the default info line is changed. If you specify 'none'
   as the info-line, it will be erased.
 
See also: info
:hub:chnick
See: chhandle
:hub:chpass
###  %bchpass%b <handle> [newpassword|rand]
   Changes a user's password. If you do not specify the new password, the user
   effectively no longer has a password set. A password is needed to get ops,
   join the party line, etc. If the newpassword is 'rand', a random password
   will be used.
 
See also: chhandle%{+n}, chsecpass
:hub:chsecpass:
###  %bchsecpass%b <handle> [newpassword|rand]
   Changes a user's secpass. If you do not specify the new password, the user
   effectively no longer has a password set. A secpass is needed to auth and
   login via DCC chat. If the newpassword is 'rand', a random password
   will be used.
 
See also: chhandle, chpass
:leaf:clearqueue
###  %bclearqueue%b <queue>
   removes all msgs from the specified queue (mode/server/help/all)
:hub:cmdpass:
###  %bcmdpass%b <command> <pass>
   Places the specified pass on the cmd so that the cmd will need to be 
   followed by the specified pass whenever it is called. For example:
    !cmdpass whoami BLAH
     [19:32] #bryan# cmdpass whoami ...
     Set command password for whoami to 'BLAH'
    !whoami
     Invalid command password. Use !command password arguments
     [19:33] bryan attempted !whoami with missing or incorrect command password
    !whoami BLAH
     You are bryan@hub.
     [19:33] #bryan# whoami
 
   To remove a cmdpass for a cmd, simply don't include the pass argument for
   a cmd.
 
   ** Only permanent owners specified in the binary COMPILE config file **
   ** can use this cmd.                                                 **
::color:
###  %bcolor%b <on/off> <mIRC/ANSI>
   Enables or disables misc coloring over DCC. Chosing mIRC will display
   color codes in mIRC format using ^K^B, etc.. while ANSI will use escape
   chars to generate the color output.
 
See also: echo, page
::comment
###  %bcomment%b <user> <comment>
   Creates or changes the comment field for a user. The comment field can only
   be seen via 'whois' or 'match'. Non-masters cannot see the comment field.
   Using the comment 'none' will clear a user's comment.
:hub:config:
###  %bconfig%b [name [value|-]]
   Sets various config options. Type alone to see all config entries. To set
   an entry do 'config name VALUE'. Use '-' as a value to clear an entry.
 
See also: botconfig
::console:
###  %bconsole%b [channel] [modes]
   Changes your console level so that you will see only the types of console
   messages that you want to. Your current console channel is the channel (that
   the bot is on) from which you can view from the party line, and which
   channel-specific commands (like 'say' and 'op') take affect on.
 
   Valid flags are:
     %bj%b  joins, parts, quits, and netsplits on the channel
     %bk%b  kicks, bans, and mode changes on the channel
     %bm%b  private msgs, notices and ctcps to the bot
     %bp%b  public text on the channel
     %bs%b  server connects, disconnects, and notices
 
%{+m}
   Masters only:
     %bb%b  information about bot linking and userfile sharing
     %bd%b  misc debug information
     %bc%b  commands
     %bo%b  misc info, etc (IMPORTANT STUFF)
     %bw%b  wallops
 
%{+n}
   Owners only (these have to be enabled in the config file via "set raw-log"):
     %be%b  errors
     %bg%b  (getin) botnet op/invite/key requests
     %bh%b  raw share traffic
     %br%b  raw incoming server traffic
     %bt%b  raw botnet traffic
     %bu%b  warnings
     %bv%b  raw outgoing server traffic
 
%{+o|o}
   The mode can also be a modifier like '+p' or '-jk' or '+mp-b'. If you omit
   the channel and modes, your current console channel and flags will be shown.
 
%{+m|m}
###  %bconsole%b <user> [channel] [modes]
   This is used to set the console level of another user. This can even be used
   on users who normally would not be able to set their own console mode.
::crontab:
###  %bcrontab%b <status|delete|show|new> [interval]
   This command is used to manipulate the crontab entries for the user
   that the bot is running on.
 
   'status' will display the status of the crontab entry for the bot,
     for example: 
     [18:59] #bryan# crontab status
     Crontabbed
   'show' will display the current crontab entries, for example:
     [18:59] #bryan# crontab show
     Showing current crontab:
     Result:
     3,8,13,18,23,28,33,38,43,48,53,58 * * * * /usr/home/bryan/hub/hub > /dev/null 2>&1
 
     1,6,11,16,21,26,31,36,41,46,51,56 * * * * /usr/home/bryan/hub/newhub > /dev/null 2>&1
   'delete' will remove the bot's own crontab entry from the crontab list.
   'new' will make the bot add it's self to the crontab list, although this is done
     automatically on startup.
::cycle:
###  %bcycle%b <channel> [delay]
   Makes all linked bots cycle the specified channel. Delay defaults to 10
   seconds, which means bots will part and not rejoin for that time.
 
See also: down
::date
###  %bdate%b
   Displays the time/date in local and GMT. Also displays which time zone
   is being used by the bot for internal logging.
:hub:dccstat
###  %bdccstat%b
   Displays a table-format list of all "dcc" connections in use on the bot.
   Dcc stands for "Direct Client-to-client Communication", and Eggdrop expands
   this to cover every open socket. Any type of network connection to the bot
   is considered a "dcc" connection.
   The headings of the table are:
     %bSOCK%b  the socket number of this connection (always unique)
     %bADDR%b  the ip address mask of the host the bot is connected to, if
           applicable
     %bPORT%b  the port number being used for this connection
     %bNICK%b  the handle of the user or bot, if applicable
     %bHOST%b  the hostname corresponding to the IP address, if available
     %bTYPE%b  the type of dcc connection (see below)
   The types of connections currently possible are as follows (but more are
   being added all the time):
     %bCHAT%b  dcc-chat partyline user
     %bPASS%b  user entering dcc chat (being asked for password)
     %bSEND%b  user sending a file
     %bGET%b   sending a file to a user
     %bGETP%b  pending get (waiting for the user to acknowledge)
     %bLSTN%b  telnet listening port (in place of a hostname, it will show the
           callback procedure name, or a mask of acceptable handles)
     %bT-IN%b  incoming telnet user (being asked for handle)
     %bFILE%b  user in dcc-chat file area
     %bBOT%b   connected bot (botnet connection)
     %bBOT*%b  pending bot link (waiting for acknowledgement)
     %bRELA%b  user in relay connection to another bot
     %b>RLY%b  bot being relay'd to (one for each "RELA")
     %bCONN%b  pending telnet connection (chat, relay, bot-link, etc)
     %bNEW%b   new user via telnet (entering a handle)
     %bNEWP%b  new user via telnet (entering a password)
   In addition, 'CHAT' and 'BOT' have flags listed for each connection. Capital
   letters mean that the flag is on, and lowercase letters mean that the flag
   is off. The flags for 'CHAT' are:
     %bC%b  in file area, but allowed to return to party line
     %bP%b  party line access only
     %bT%b  telnet connection (instead of dcc chat)
     %bE%b  echo is on
     %bP%b  paging is on
     %b6%b  socket is ipv6
   The flags for 'BOT' are:
     %bP%b  ping sent, waiting for reply
     %bU%b  user-file sharing is active
     %bC%b  local bot initiated the connection
     %bO%b  user-file offered, waiting for reply
     %bS%b  in the process of sending the user-file
     %bG%b  in the process of getting the user-file
     %bW%b  warned this bot to stop hubbing
     %bL%b  leaf-only bot (not allowed to be a hub)
     %bI%b  bot is currently in the 'linking' stage
     %bA%b  bot is being aggressively shared with
   For 'CHAT' users, the party-line channel is also listed.
::debug
###  %bdebug%b
   Display a dump of memory allocation information, assuming the bot was
   compiled with memory debugging. It's useless to anyone but developers
   trying to find memory leaks.
:leaf:deluser
###  %bdeluser%b <nickname>
   deletes a user record for a user on the channel, using their
   current hostname.  Channel masters can remove users so long as
   the user isn't a bot master.
 
see also: adduser%{+m}, +user, -user%{-}
:leaf:deop
###  %bdeop%b <nickname> [channel|*]
   will remove chanop from the person you specify, so long as the
   bot is opped on that channel, and the person you specify isn't
   on the bot's list of authorized chanops. Specify * for all
   channels.
 
See also: op, console
:leaf:devoice
### %bdevoice%b <nickname> [channel|*]
    will remove the +v voice from the person you specify, so long as
    the bot is opped on that channel. Specify * for all channels.
::die
###  %bdie%b [reason]
   This kills the bot. The bot goes offline immediately, logging who issued
   the 'die' command. You shouldn't have to use this too often. If you specify
   a reason, it is logged, otherwise the reason is "authorized by <handle>".
::down:
###  %bdown%b <channel>
   All linked bots will deop themselves in the specified channel. They
   will not reop for 10 seconds.
 
See also: cycle
:hub:downbots
###  %bdownbots%b
   Shows the list of bots that are NOT currently linked to the botnet.
 
   Example:
      Down bots: cEvin, ruthie, Killa1
 
See also: bots
:leaf:dump
###  %bdump%b <text>
   dumps the text to the server.  keep in mind that this bot doesn't
   run through ircII, so ircII commands will most likely not work this
   way.  they need to be raw irc codes. read rfc1459 from ftp.internic.net
   for more help.
::echo
###  %becho%b <on/off>
   Specifies whether you want your messages echoed back to you. If it's on,
   then when you say something on the party line, it will be displayed to you
   just like everyone else will see it. If it's off, then it won't happen.
 
See also: color, page
::exec:
###  %bexec%b <params>
   The bot will execute the specified program with each param specified,
   and display the results over DCC.
::exempts
###  %bexempts%b [[channel/all]/wildcard]
   Shows you a list of the global exempts active on the current channel, and
   the list of channel-specific exempts, as well as any exempts that are on the
   channel but weren't placed by the bot.
 
   Here's a sample entry;
      ! [ 3] *!test@test.com (perm)
             Wcc: requested
             Created 01:15
 
   The number (3) can be used to reference the exempt if you wish to remove it
   (see %b'-exempt'%b). Next is the actual hostmask being exempted. The "(perm)"
   means that the exempt is "permanent": that is, it doesn't automatically
   expire. If there is an elapsed time showing instead, the time displayed is
   how long the exempt has been active. These types of exempts expire after one
   hour. The second line of the exempt entry is the comment ("requested"), and
   who set the exempt (Wcc). The last line shows when the exempt was added, and
   possibly the last time the exempt was activated on the channel (if it's
   different from the creation time).
 
   Sometimes there will be a "!" or "*" right before the number. A "!" means
   the exempt is in the bot's exempt list, but is not currently on the channel.
   A "*" marks an exempt which is NOT in the bot's exempt list but IS on the
   channel.
 
   If you use 'exempts' without an argument, it will show you only the exempts
   which are currently active on the channel. If you use 'exempts all', it will
   show you every exempt in the global exempt list and on the channel. If you
   use 'exempts <wildcard>', it will list all exempts (active or not) that
   match against your wildcard. Consider it a 'exempts all' list matched
   against your wildcard.
 
   The exempt list may change according to which channel you're currently
   viewing in the console. Different exempts may be active on different
   channels. If you specify a channel name, that channel will be used instead
   of your current console channel.
 
See also: -exempt, +exempt, console%{+m|m}, chanset, chaninfo%{-}, stick, unstick
:leaf:find:
###  %bfind%b  <nick!ident@host.com>
   The bot will search through all of it's channel records and look
   for the specified hostmask.  Wildcards are accepted; '*' for 1 or more
   characters, or '?' for exactly 1 character.
::fixcodes
### %bfixcodes%b
     This is for use in situations where the bot gets mixed up about the type
     of connection you have with it. For example, you /CTCP CHAT the bot and
     it thinks you are connecting via telnet, and you see text displayed as
     "Local time is now [1m17:17[0m" for example instead of "Local time is
     now 17:17". Use this to turn telnet codes on or off/change the display
     mode.
::fwd
###  %bfwd%b <handle> [desto]
   This allows you to set a note forwarding address for a user,
   this means if a note needs to be stored for the user, the
   bot will attempt to pass it on to the given user@bot, if
   the bot is not online then the note is still stored locally,
   if the other user doesn't exist, the note is lost. Boohoo.
:leaf:getkey:
###  %bgetkey%b [channel]
   If there is a key set for channel, it is displayed. If channel is not
   specified, your console channel is used.
 
See also: console, channels%{+m}, status
::handle
###  %bhandle%b <new-handle>
   Changes your handle on the bot. This is the handle (nickname) that the
   bot will know you as from this point forward. It is used to log into the
   bot.
 
See also: newpass%{+m}, %(hub)chhand, chpass%{+n}, chsecpass
::help:
###  %bhelp%b [cmd]
   Alone, will show all cmds that match your flags. With a cmd it will show
   the help entry, such as you see here. Specifying a wildcard will display
   a list of cmds (matching your flags) that match that wildcard. Use '*'
   to match 1 or more characters, and '?' to match exactly one character.
:hub:hublevel:
###  %bhublevel%b <hub-bot> <level>
   Sets the hublevel for the specified hub. This command is not recommended
   for use by anyone. Instead you should change your COMPILE config file
   and update your net with new binaries.
 
See also: uplink, chaddr
::ignores
###  %bignores%b [wildcard]
   Shows a list of hostmasks from which the bot is currently ignoring msgs,
   notices, etc. There are two types of ignores: permanent and temporary.
   Permanent ignores never automatically expire. You must use %b'%d-ignore'%b
   to remove them.
   Here is a sample permanent ignore:
      [  1] *!*@217.156.44.184 (perm)
            Wcc: go away
            Started 523 days ago
   The number (1) can be used to reference the ignore if you wish to remove it
   (see %b'%dhelp -ignore'%b). Next is the actual hostmask being ignored. The
   "(perm)" means that the ignore is "permanent": that is, it doesn't
   automatically expire. The second line of the ignore entry is the comment
   ("go away"), and who set the ban (Wcc). The last line shows when the ignore
   was added.
   Here is a sample temporary ignore:
      [ 10] blah!blah@blah.cc (expires in 1 day)
            Wcc: requested
            Started 18:02
   Here, you see the "perm" in the parentheses next to the hostmask is instead
   an expire time. This means that the ignore will expire automatically in one
   day.
   If you use %b'%dignores <wildcard>'%b, it will list all the ignores
   that match against your wildcard.
 
See also: +ignore, -ignore
::info
###  %binfo%b [channel] [info-line]
   Sets your info line. This line is shown via the /msg commands %b'who'%b and
   %b'whois'%b. If you have set greet on, it is also shown when you joins the
   channel. If the info line begins with an '@', then it is "locked", and tou
   may no longer change it.
 
%{+m|m}See also: chinfo%{-}
:leaf:invite
###  %binvite%b <nickname> [channel|*]
   invites someone from irc into your current console channel (or
   specified other channel).  This is most useful when the channel
   is +i.  a user with the +o flag can also request an invite from
   the bot with /MSG INVITE. Specify * for all channels.
 
See also: console
::invites
###  %binvites%b [[channel/all]/wildcard]
   Shows you a list of the global invites active on the current channel, and
   the list of channel-specific invites, as well as any invites that are on the
   channel but weren't placed by the bot.
 
   Here's a sample entry;
      ! [ 3] *!test@test.com (perm)
             Wcc: requested
             Created 01:15
 
   The number (3) can be used to reference the invite if you wish to remove it
   (see %b'-invite'%b). Next is the actual hostmask being invited. The "(perm)"
   means that the invite is "permanent": that is, it doesn't automatically
   expire. If there is an elapsed time showing instead, the time displayed is
   how long the invite has been active. These types of invites expire after one
   hour. The second line of the invite entry is the comment ("requested"), and
   who set the invite (Wcc). The last line shows when the invite was added, and
   possibly the last time the invite was activated on the channel (if it's
   different from the creation time).
 
   Sometimes there will be a "!" or "*" right before the number. A "!" means
   the invite is in the bot's invite list, but is not currently on the channel.
   A "*" marks an invite which is NOT in the bot's invite list but IS on the
   channel.
 
   If you use 'invites' without an argument, it will show you only the invites
   which are currently active on the channel. If you use 'invites all', it will
   show you every invite in the global invite list and on the channel. If you
   use 'invites <wildcard>', it will list all invites (active or not) that
   match against your wildcard. Consider it a 'invites all' list matched
   against your wildcard.
 
   The invite list may change according to which channel you're currently
   viewing in the console. Different invites may be active on different
   channels. If you specify a channel name, that channel will be used instead
   of your current console channel.
 
See also: -invite, +invite, console%{+m|m}, chanset, chaninfo%{-}, stick, unstick
:leaf:jump
###  %bjump%b [server [port [pass]]]
   Makes the bot jump to another server. If you don't specify a
   server, it will jump to the next server in it'ss internal list (see
   %b'help config'%b). If you specify a server, it will jump to that
   server (default port is 6667), and if that server is not in the
   internal list already, it will add it (until the bot relinks).
   Jumping servers ALWAYS makes the bot lose ops! be careful!
 
See also: botjump, servers, botserver
:leaf:kick
###  %bkick%b [channel|*] <nickname> [reason]
   Will kick a user off your current console channel (or specified
   other channel) with the comment given.  if you omit the reason,
   the default kick comment is "requested". Specify * for all 
   channels.
 
See also: kickban, console
:leaf:kickban
###  %bkickban%b [channel|*] [-|@]<nickname> [comment]
   kicks a user off the channel and bans her by a reasonable host-
   mask.  your nickname will be attached to the ban in the bot's
   internal ban list, and the ban will last for whatever is set in
   ban-time -- only on this channel.  use %b'%d+ban'%b for a more
   permanent ban which will be activated on every channel the bot
   monitors.  if you use a comment, that will also be attached to
   the ban in the ban list, and used as the kick comment. Specify 
   * for all channels.
     appending a prefix of ! or @ to a nickname changes the ban
   mask used:
        e.g. with a host of nick!ident@host.name.domain
 
        command        banmask
        .kickban nick  *!*dent@*.name.domain
        .kickban -nick *!*dent@host.name.domain
        .kickban @nick *!*@host.name.domain
 
        with a host of nick!~ident@host.name.domain (strict-host set to 1)
 
        command        banmask
        .kickban nick  *!*ident@*.name.domain
        .kickban -nick *!*ident@host.name.domain
 
See also: +ban, bans, stick
:hub:lagged:
###  %blagged%b
   Displays the bot's internal ping list of bots linked to it.
   If a pingtime goes over 30 seconds, it is delinked for
   ping timeout.
 
See also: netlag
::last:
###  %blast%b 
   Displays the 'last' output from the shell the bot is running on,
   for the user it is running as.
 
%{hub}See also: netlast
:hub:link
###  %blink%b [via-bot] <bot-to-link>
   Attempts to link to another hub.  This command is deprecated and not 
   recommended for use.
 
See also: unlink, newleaf%{+a}, -bot
::match
###  %bmatch%b <attr> [channel] [[start] limit]
   This displays all user records with the attributes requested.
   "attr" is of the form:  <+/-><global>[&/|<channel>[&/|<bot>]]
   Specifying "&" as the separator will cause AND style matching.
   For example:
      .match p&o
   This will match all users with both the "p" global flag and the "o" channel
   flag on your current console channel.
   Specifying "|" as the separator will cause OR style matching.
   For example:
     .match p|o
   This will match all users with either the "p" global flag or the "o" channel
   flag on your current console channel. If you specify a channel, it will be
   used instead of the current console channel.
   For example:
     .match p|o #eggdrop
   This will match all users with either the "p" global flag or the "o" channel
   flag on the channel #eggdrop. You can also match bot flags.
   For example:
     .match o|o|h
   This will match all bots with either the "o" global flag, the "o" channel
   flag on the current console channel, or the "h" botflag. You can also limit
   the number of total results returned by specifying a limit at the end of the
   command. A starting point can also be specified.
   For example:
     .match p&o #eggdrop 16 25
   This would show results 16 through 25 matching any users with the "p" global
   flag or the "o" channel flag on #eggdrop.
###  %bmatch%b <wildcard-string> [[start] limit]
   This displays all user records where the user's handle or any of the user's
   hostmasks match the specified wildcard string. You can also limit the number
   of total results returned by specifying a limit at the end of the command. A
   starting point can also be specified.
   For example:
     .match *.edu 16 25
   This would show results 16 through 25 matching any users with a hostmask
   that ends with ".edu".
:leaf:mdop:
###  %bmdop%b <#channel> [bots=n] [alines=n] [slines=n] [overlap=n] [bitch] [simul]
   For those of us who do not wish to be rocket scientists in the mdop department, 
   a simple '%dmdop #channel' will suffice.
   **Remember, the bot you mdop on will never participate in the deopping**
 
   options:
 
     %bbitch%b   - set +bitch after finished with mdop.
     %bsimul%b   - Simulates the mdop. IE: Gives you a practice run, will show who 
                   does what in the dcc chat window.
 
     =============================================================================
     don't bother setting the following options unless you REALLY know what you're 
     doing, and don't bother messaging me asking me how to use them if you don't.
     =============================================================================
     %bbots%b    - Number of bots to use for mdop.
     %balines%b  - Number of MODE lines to assume each participating bot will get through.
     %bslines%b  - Number of MODE lines each participating bot will send.
     %boverlap%b - Number of times to deop each target nick (using alines for calc).
 
   bots, alines, slines and overlap are dependant on each other, set them wrong and
   the bot will complain. 
  
   Defaults are alines=3, slines=5, overlap=2. alines will be increased up to 5 if 
   there are not enough bots available.
::me
###  %bme%b <text>
   Performs an action on the party line. This appears as "* Wcc is leaving",
   etc.
:leaf:mop:
###  %bmop%b [channel|*]
   Bot will op all users in the specified channel that are valid ops
   for the channel. If '*' is specified, the bot will scan all channels
   and op all users in all channels that are valid ops in each chan. If 
   no channel is specified, the console channel is used.

   is opped on that channel, and the person you specify isn't being
   actively deopped by the bot. Specify * for all channels.
 
See also: deop, console
::page
### %bpage%b <number/off>
   This allows you to slow down the number of lines the bot sends you at once
   via the partyline. When enabled, any commands that send greater than the
   specified number of lines will stop when that number is reached and wait for
   you to type another command (or press enter) to continue. If you have too
   many pending lines, you may be booted off the bot.
 
See also: echo, color
::ps:
###  %bps%b [ps-param]

::relay
###  %brelay%b <bot>
   Relays you via telnet to another bot, whether or not it is currently linked.
   The local bot must, however, have a bot record for the bot you wish to
   relay to. Typing .quit or "*bye*" on a line by itself will end the relay.
 
See also: bots%{+n}, newleaf%{+a}, -bot
::reload
###  %breload%b
   Reloads the bot's user file, discarding any changes made since the last
   %b'%dsave'%b command or hourly user file save. Sharebots should probably
   never do this.
 
See also: save
:leaf:reset
###  %breset%b [channel]
   clears out the bot's channel information and makes it gather the
   information from the server all over again, as if it had just
   joined that channel.  it's not really useful much, but could be
   if an odd bug causes the channel information to get scrambled.
   unfortunately this command used to get a lot of use.  you can omit
   the channel name to make it reset ALL channels.
:leaf:resetbans
###  %bresetbans%b [channel]
   resets the bot's ban list for the channel. any bans on the channel
   that aren't in the ban list (either the global list or the local
   channel ban list) will be removed, and if there are any bans in the
   global ban list or channel ban list that are not currently on the
   channel, they will be added.
 
See also: bans, console%{+m|m}, reset
:leaf:resetexempts
###  %bresetexempts%b [channel]
   resets the bot's exemption list for the channel. this command
   behaves exactly like resetbans, except it is for exempts.
 
See also: resetbans, resetinvites
:leaf:resetinvites
###  %bresetinvites%b [channel]
   resets the bot's invitation list for the channel. this command
   behaves exactly like resetbans, except it is for invites.
 
See also: resetbans, resetinvites
::restart
###  %brestart%b
   Restarts the Tcl interpreter, wipes all timers, reloads all modules, and
   reloads the config file for the bot (which resets any changes made via the
   %b'%dset'%b command and reloads any Tcl scripts your config loads). As with
   the %b'%drehash'%b command, it also saves and reloads the user file from disk.
 
See also: reload, save
:hub:save
###  %bsave%b
   This makes the bot write its entire userfile to disk. This is useful if you
   think the bot is about to crash or something, since the user file is only
   written to disk about once an hour.
 
See also: reload, backup
:leaf:say
###  %bsay%b [channel] <text>
   dumps the text to your current console channel (or other specified
   channel), as if the bot "said" it.
::secpass:
###  %bsecpass%b <password|rand>
   Changes your secpass on the bot. This is used for Authing via /msg
   and for DCC. If the password is 'rand', a random password will be used.
 
%(hub)%{+m}See also: chpass%{+n}, chsecpass
:leaf:servers
###  %bservers%b
   lists the servers that the bot has in its server list.  this is
   the list it rotates through when changing servers.  it starts
   with a static list which it loads from its config-file when the
   bot is booted up.  after that, you can add servers with the
   %b'%djump'%b command.  the server list will indicate which server the
   bot is currently on.
::simul
###  %bsimul%b <handle> <text>
   This allows you to simulate the specified handle typing the given text.
   For example:
      %dsimul dweeb%d.quit
   This would appear just as if "dweeb" typed "%dquit". This command will not
   work unless eggdrop has simul enabled in the config file. 
 
See also: su
::slowjoin:
###  %bslowjoin%b <channel> <interval-seconds> [channel-options]
   All bots on the botnet will join the channel at the rate of one bot
   per 'interval-seconds'. If any channel-options are specified, the 
   channel will be added with those options.  If the channel is set
   +take, when just 1 bot is opped, the rest of the botnet will 
   immediately join and proceed to 'take'. :)
 
See also: slowpart, chanset, chaninfo
::slowpart:
###  %bslowpart%b <channel> <interval-seconds>
   All bots on the botnet will part the specified channel at the rate
   of one bot per 'interval-seconds'
 
%{+n}See also: slowjoin
::status
###  %bstatus%b
###  %bstatus all%b
   Displays a condensed block of status information about the bot.
   is running. For example:
      [01:15] #Wcc# status
      I am Anakha, running eggdrop v1.6.16+stripping:  171 users (mem: 315k)
      Online for 14 days, 02:50  (background)  CPU 71:29  cache hit 40.3%
      Admin: Wcc
      Config file: eggdrop.conf
      OS: FreeBSD 4.8-RELEASE-p1
      Tcl library: /usr/local/lib/tcl8.4
      Tcl version: 8.4.2 (header version 8.4.2)
      Loaded module information:
          Channels: #|DAWG|Net, #|DAWG|Tcl
          Online as: D|Anakha!wcc@cia.nu (|DAWG|Anakha - |DAWG|Net)
          Server irc.inet.tele.dk:6667 (connected for 11 days)
          #|DAWG|Net:  6 members, enforcing "+istn" (lurking)
          #|DAWG|Tcl: 42 members, enforcing "+tn" (lurking)
 
 
   The first line tells you the bot's name, what version of Eggdrop it's
   running, the number of users the bot has records of, and the amount of
   memory being used by the userfile. The second line tells you the uptime of
   the bot, CPU time, and cache hit. The third shows the bot's admin, and the
   forth shows its current config file. The fifth line shows what operating
   system the bot is running on. The next two lines show Tcl information. If
   debug mode is enabled, additional info may be shown. Sharing information
   will also be shown if it's being used.
 
   Select information from modules will be displayed after the core
   information. If you use %b'%dstatus all'%b instead, you will see all status
   information available from loaded modules.
 
See also: channel, channels%{+a}, debug
::stick
###  %bstick%b [ban/exempt/invite] <hostmask/number> [channel]
   Makes a ban, exempt, or invite "sticky". This means that the bot will always
   try to keep it active on the channel. Obviously, if the channel isn't using 
   dynamic bans, this has no effect.
 
See also: bans, exempts, invites, unstick, +ban, +exempt, +invite
::store
###  %bstore%b
   Stores your console settings so that they are restored automatically the
   next time you join the party line. ('console' calls this auto)
 
See also: console
::strip
###  %bstrip%b [modes]
   Allows you to remove embedded 'attribute' codes your partyline output. Valid
   options are:
      %bb%b - remove all boldface codes
      %bc%b - remove all color codes
      %br%b - remove all reverse video codes
      %bu%b - remove all underline codes
      %ba%b - remove all ANSI codes
      %bg%b - remove all ctrl-g (bell) codes
   The mode can also be a modifier like '+c' or '-bu' or '+ru-c'. If
   you omit modes, it will show your current setting.
 
See also: fixcodes, color, echo
%{+m}
###  %bstrip%b <user> [modes]
   Set the strip level of another user. A master can't set their own strip
   flags without prefixing the modes with a '+' or '-'.
::su
###  %bsu%b <user>
   Lets you assume the identity of another user. If you are a global owner,
   this does not require a password. Otherwise, you will be asked for the
   user's password. %b%dquit%b returns you to your original handle.
:leaf:topic
###  %btopic%b <text>
   changes the channel's topic, assuming the bot is a chanop or the
   channel is not +t (uses your current console channel).
 
See also: console
:hub:trace
###  %btrace%b <bot>
   Sends out a trace signal to another bot. If/when the trace signal returns,
   (and it should!) you will get an output that looks something like this:
      Trace result -> Valis:Stonewall:NoBoty:SomeBoty
 
   This is a list of the bots connected between you and the destination bot.
   It should also return the time in seconds taken for the trace to occur.

::who
###  %bwho%b [bot]
   Displays a list of users on the local bot.
 
   For example:
      [23:21] #Wcc# who
      Party line members:  (* = owner, + = master, @ = op)
      *Wcc       telnet@xxx.atlaga.adelphia.net (idle 17m)
      *Wcc       telnet@xxx.atlaga.adelphia.net
      Bots connected:
      -> wortel (05 Dec 16:32) eggdrop v1.6.15 <efnet>
 
   The first section is people on your current channel (the party line, if you
   haven't changed channels) who are on the bot. A '*' will precede the handle
   if they are a bot owner, "+" if they are a master, "%%" if they are a botnet
   master, or "@" if they are an op. The user's nickname, hostname, and
   possibly an idle time and/or away message will be displayed.%{+n} Owners
   will also see the user's dcc idx.%{-}
 
   The next section is bots directly linked to the current bot. The arrow
   indicates which bot initiated the connection. The right arrow means this bot
   connected to wortel. A left arrow means the remote bot linked to this bot. A
   '+' next to the arrow indicates that the bot is sharing userfiles with us.
   The connection time (05 Dec 16:32) and bot version are also shown, as well
   as what is specified under "network" in the config file.%{+n} Owners will
   also see the bot's dcc idx.%{-}
 
   The final section (not shown in example above) is a list of users on the
   local bot who are not on your channel. This will be omitted if there are no
   users on other channels. If you specify the name of a remote bot, for
   example %b'%dwho valis'%b, the who request will be sent to that bot instead.
   The remote bot must be linked to the botnet.
%{+m}
 
   Masters may also see "(con <flags>)" after a user's entry, which shows the
   user's console flags/modes (see %b'%dhelp console'%b).
 
   In the final section (users that aren't on the current channel), masters
   will see the actual channels other users are on. Also, people in the
   filesystem will be listed (as being in channel "files") if the filesys
   module is loaded. A '+' next to the nickname here means the user has
   access to return to the party line.

   Hostmasks for the user are displayed on the following lines. If the user is
   a bot, there will be a line below which says "ADDRESS:" and gives the bot's
   telnet address. Some user entries may have "EMAIL:" and "INFO:" entries too.
   There may be additional information displayed depending on the modules
   loaded, such as filesys and console.
