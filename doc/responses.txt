 asl?
 wat
 d/c
 ignored
 I think you got the wrong person...
 ...
 lol
 I have put you on a permanent ignore, public and private. I have found you disturbing, rude and generally not worth talking to.\nAccording to the channels you hang on, it strengtens the effect of wanting to put you on ignore because of my lack of interest in you as a person. This message is not meant to be rude to you, just to inform you that i won't see anything of what you type from now on.
 msg me again and u drop
 how about i do a nice icmp ping, figure out where you are and what you are on, spawn your command.com to a port of my choice and log in with telnet and have a field day with you.
:baduserpass
 stop wasting my time.
 gtg
 go away
 go away already
 fuck off already
 ehh..no, bye.
 you're still here?
 jesus loves you, but I ain't jesus. \002FUCK OFF\002

 whatever man, cya
 lewser
 try again, newb
 newb
 haha, no.
 lol
 dont care
 d/c
 reporting you for spam.
 Congratulations, prick, you've just made my ignore list. Was it worth it to you to make your 'witty' comments and snide in-jokes to your irc pals about me if it meant you are now disappeared from my online experience? Have a nice life.
