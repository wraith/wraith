1. Pack settings
2. Compiling
3. Making bots

Step 1: Pack settings

The files listed here are all located in pack/, and will need to be saved for future compiles.
If you have pack.cff place it in pack/

pack.cfg(.sample):
 Simply edit it and change accordingly 
 Rename to pack.cfg when completed and make sure it is in pack/


Step 2: Compiling

For leaf build: ./build leaf
For hub build: ./build hub
To build both: ./build all
To compile a debug version of the pack, add -d in as a option before the type.
 ie, ./build -d leaf

During the compile process many warnings may appear on screen, ignore them. Only report ERRORS please.
After the compile process is finished, the binaries will be placed in wraith.OS.version.tgz.
 The OS and version are dynamic depending on the pack build, type 'ls' to find exact name.


Step 3: Making bots

simply do ./binary -C
You may need to 'export EDITOR=pico' or to whatever editor you prefer.
Make sure you check all settings presented.

If you were updating an old bot on the shell:
./old_binary -U new_binary
If you want bots to auto restart use '-u' instead
