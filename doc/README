wraith by bryan (see CREDITS)

This was rushed, so its not as simple as I'd like it to be..
Read all of this through, then try what it says, if you fail, try again and make sure you are doing it correctly, if so
then ask bryan: AIM: Bryan M Drewery

First, get tcl 8.4..
	http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/download84.html
	http://aleron.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/tcl/tcl8.4.4-src.tar.gz
Then, untar it, cd to the dir, cd unix, ./configure --prefix=/home/YOU --exec-prefix=/home/YOU --disable-shared

Now, go back to the pack dir..
Edit bldall, at the top change the directory to your homedir
next, gcc -o makesalt makesalt.c
./makesalt
mv salt.h src/
edit src/settings.c
Edit pack.cfg (dont change anything in this actually.)
Now, ./build all pack
Ignore any warnings, any errors report to bryan
There are your binaries for the OS you compiled on..: leaf, hub

DONT LOSE: settings.c salt.h


Making bots:
edit conf, (it has instructions in it)
then, ./binary -e conf .known_hosts (either binary is fine, -d would decrypt.)
tar -czvf somebot.tgz .known_hosts binary
then upload somebot.tgz to whatever shell..
LEAF:
untar, mkdir ~/.ssh;mv .known_hosts ~/.ssh
Binary: ~/.sshrc
Conf: ~/.ssh/.known_hosts
./leaf
HUB:
untar, mv .known_hosts conf;./hub
Binary: /wheverever/you/want // just make sure the file conf is in the same dir
Conf: /where/you/put/your/hub/conf

You can do ./binary -d /path/to/conf somefile, and edit it on the shell of course to add more bots or change vhosts...
The hub conf is /path/to/hubdir/conf
the leaf conf is /home/you/.ssh/.known_hosts
Dont forget to encrypt them :)

UPDATING:
Get the new src from bryan.
Copy your salt.h, settings.c and bldall files and put them in their respect directories in the untarred newsrc..
./bldall pack
./leaf -v
(uname -s)
cp leaf leaf.Os.ver
cp hub hub.Os.hub
Set a hub +U 
Then on that hub, copy all the binaries for the new version to it's dir..
whatever os you are in, copy the appropiate new hub binary to 'newhub', then on the hub, type .update newhub
Sit back and cry as all the bots die probably.. nah j/k

This will all be improved over time, and you won't need to redo your entire net ever...

Channel modes:
	Read eggdrop docs.
	Additions:
	+/-fastop, -fastop does cookieops
	+voice voices all except +q users and people that > |+m devoice
	+closed is like +locked (kicks all non-users and keeps +i set)
        +nomop Kicks users who set +ooo*
	Anything not listed here or in eggdrop docs is not finished.

Warnings:
	Do not set a channel +voice, and then op a bot that is not linked to the wraith botnet.
	  This will cause some serious bot fights.



Memorize these:
To see what commands they give access to:
  See http://www.shatow.net/vb/showthread.php?s=&threadid=33
(that may be old, but the general idea is there)

Only +a can give certain flags, I forget which ones, but you'll figure that out ;)

   Global  Chan    Does
   --------------------------------------------------
   a               administrator
   b               bot
   c               leaf chat hub (leaf that accepts /dcc chat or /ctcp chat)
                   There is no limit to chat hubs, set all leafs +c if you want.
                   Better idea to just set a few leafs +c and tell your users.
   d       d       auto deop (never +o)
   e       e       exempt from stopnethack //useless
   f       f       friend
   h               highlighting //useless
   i               hub access
   j               leaf chat hub access
   k       k       autokick (never on chan)
   l       l       bot sets limit
   m       m       master
   n       n       owner
   o       o       op
   p               partyline chat access (-p wont be able to talk)
   q       q       quiet (never +v)
   s               bot is sec hub (NOT FUNCTIONAL YET, DO NOT SET)
   u               bot is the updatehub (MAKE SURE IT HAS OOGLES OF BW)
   v       v       auto-voice
   w       w       bot gives autovoice
   x       x       users is exempt for flood kicks
   y       y       bot gives out voices


important console modes:
	+m msgs
	+o misc
	+s server
	+e errors
	+u warnings
	+w wallops
	+c cmds
	+b bots
