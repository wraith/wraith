This file is obsolete and will be cleared shortly by the new .help system.


Channel modes:
	Read eggdrop docs.
	Additions:
	+/-fastop, -fastop does cookieops
	+voice voices all except +q users and people that > m|+m devoice
	+closed is like ghost's +locked (kicks all non-users and keeps +i set)
        +nomop Kicks users who set +ooo*
	Anything not listed here or in eggdrop docs is not finished.

Warnings:
	Do not set a channel +voice, and then op a bot that is not linked to the wraith botnet.
	  This will cause some serious bot fights, because the other bot might have a user
          on auto devoice.. think about that for a minute.



Only +a can give certain flags, I forget which ones, but you'll figure that out ;)
Execute the cmd 'help' to view which cmds these flags give access to.

Important console modes:
	+m msgs
	+o misc
	+s server
	+e errors
	+u warnings
	+w wallops
	+c cmds
	+b bots
	+d debug (You probably won't want to see all of this)
set with .console +abcde
