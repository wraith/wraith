Get the new src from bryan.
Copy your salt.h, settings.c and bldall files and put them in their respect directories in the untarred newsrc..
./bldall pack
./leaf -v
(uname -s)
cp leaf leaf.Os.ver
cp hub hub.Os.hub
Set a hub +U
Then on that hub, copy all the binaries for the new version to it's dir..
whatever os you are in, copy the appropiate new hub binary to 'newhub', then on the hub, type .update newhub
Sit back and cry as all the bots die probably.. nah j/k

This will all be improved over time, and you won't need to redo your entire net ever...
