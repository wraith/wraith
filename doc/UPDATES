10.Rewrote update system once again, seems to be working flawlessly now.
   Binaries are no longer compressed on send, use upx for linux binaries.
   Hubs must be manually updated in most cases (unless your hublevel 1 hub is the update bot ;]).
   Just ftp the new binary, and use .botupdate.
11.Added cmds: botupdate, botkill, net/botcrontab.
12.Removed cmd_rehash; cmd_restart does nothing for now.
13.Fixed +take.
14.Added ctcp cloaking.
15.All kicks are cloaked correctly now .
